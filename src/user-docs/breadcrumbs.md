# Breadcrumbs

The breadcrumbs on top of the graph depict the hierarchy from the top node of the graph to the currently selected node (e.g., `All_Subsystem_Groups >> Subsystem Group 1 >> Subsystem A`). The breadcrumbs reflect the layer depth currently rendered. They are also interactive and can be used to search for nodes in different layers.
