# Tabs
## Navigation Tab
Use this tab to highlight a node currently rendered from the Show node in visualization, or any node saved in the tool's database, from the Find & select node from database. The History section shows previously selected nodes.

## Visualization Tab
This tab contains options to modify the complexity of the rendered graph.

### Layer Depth
Use the Layer depth slider to increase or decrease the layer depth. The highest depth is the highest for the graph unless a node is selected. In that case, the highest depth equals the depth of the selected node. Adjust the lowest depth to simplify or add more details to the graph.

### Outgoing vs Incoming dependencies
Toggle the radio buttons labeled Query & show outgoing/incoming relationships to visualize outgoing and incoming dependencies.

### Limiting dependency scope
To visualize local dependencies (all dependencies under a selected node), toggle off the show domain internal relationships radio button.

### Layout algorithm
Use this dropdown to change the layout of the nodes. Currently, only three options are available. Klay (the default one) works best.

## Analysis Tab
The analysis tab contains options to modify the node sizing and coloring.
