By default, nodes and edges can have different colors.

## Node colors
Nodes are gray by default, but they can be colored differently, using the color attribute in the input files.

## Edge colors
Edges can be black, orange, or red.


- __Black edges__: allowed dependencies.

- __Red ones__: violations.
